# Participant Scheduler
## The Problem
I wanted to be able to schedule multiple people to participate in my research, but other scheduling applications just weren't cutting it.
When2Meet would've required me to make a new link for each new set of dates that I chose. Plus there was no google calendar integration.
Timeful implemented a google calendar integration, but didn't allow specific dates (e.g., could only pick Monday - Friday)

## The Solution
I wanted a calendar scheduling application where I could send a link to people interested in participating in my research, where they could quickly and easily fill out the times they were available. Additionally, I wanted to integrate all of my google calendars (e.g., personal calendar, lab calendar, work calendar) to easily determine when to schedule participants for the experiment. 

## Open-Source Code
I've chosen to make this web application completely open-source so that other programmers can use, build upon, and contribute to. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make any changes you'd like. Pull requests are more than welcome!

## Use
As of now, anyone can create an account by signing in with their gmail, creating an event, and sending the link off to get availability. I hope this makes the lives of researchers, managers, and anyone else who requires scheduling multiple people for meetings, just a little bit easier!
